# T1A1 - Workbook

**Research** the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must **describe** at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

Before the Internet was "the Internet", the predecessor was known as ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).  The ARPANET was the first network that could transmit groups of data digitally into packets, and the first to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite[1]. Established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defence, the project was lead by J. C. R. Licklider and Bob Taylor, now prominent figures in computer science development for their major contributions to the personal computer and related technologies[2]. The project managed to connect computers for the first time on October 29, 1969 between Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and UCLA[3]. The creation of the ARPANET set the foundations for what would become the Internet.

The World Wide Web, also known as the Web, was first started as an initiative designed to bring a global information universe into existence using available technology[4]. It was invented in 1989 by English Scientist Sir Timothy Berners-Lee, who was working at CERN, the largest Internet node in Europe at the time. By 1990, he had written the three fundamental technologies that still continue to exist as the foundation of the modern web: HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol, HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language, and URI: Uniform Resource Identifier; as well as the world's first Internet Browser and server.

Computer-based mail and messaging was first introduced in 1961, with MIT's Compatible Time-Sharing System. Users were able to store and share files on a central disk from remote terminals, which in turn were using this to pass on messages.[5] From there, methods to pass messages were developed and expanded upon, with HoTMaiL being one of the first webmail services on the internet, commercially launching on July 4 1996[6]. Now there are a variety of webmail services, with Google, Yahoo, AOL and ZohoMail. At the time the limit for mail storage space on HoTMaiL was only 2MB, now Outlook, the HoTMaiL successor, stores up to 15GB of storage, whereas other webservices boast 1TB storage or even unlimited.

In 1993, NCSA Mosaic was introduced to the world by Marc Andreessen and Eric Bina, two programmers working for NCSA.  Mosaic was one of the first web browsers of the Internet with a graphical interface that integrated text and graphics; massively popularising the World Wide Web to the general public. Now there are many browsers users can choose from: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera and more.

In January 1996, two PhD students at Stanford University began a research project nicknamed BackRub, a world wide web crawler. Now that same project is used everyday all over the globe under the name of Google. Before Google, one of the first "full text" search engines was WebCrawler in 1994, well renowned at the time for its ability to search for any word in any webpage, a feature that was not possible at the time, it was so popular that at peak times the server would be overloaded.

One technology that has rapidly improved over time is the webcam. The webcam is a small video camera that streams an image or video instantaneously through a computer, laptop or to the internet. The first webcam ever developed was around 1991 in the Trojan Room, a computer laboratory at the University of Cambridge. In order to save time for workers in the building from coming down to an empty coffee pot, researchers placed a camera connected to all the computers on the office network that streamed the image of the coffee pot. It wasn't until 1993 that the researchers connected the live stream to the internet, as the internet had gained the ability to display images and the coffee pot live stream gained popularity worldwide. At that time, the Trojan Room webcam would display an image resolution of 128x128px in greyscale, now as webcams developed over time with display technologies, USB interface speeds and broadband internet speeds, the resolution has evolved from 320x240px to 640x480px and now up to 1280x720px and 1920x1080px resolution.

| Q2   | **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:  - packets  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)  - routers and routing  - domains and DNS  **Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet. | 50 - 100 words per dot point                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | In order to send information over the Internet and most computer networks, information is broken up into smaller parts known as packets. A packet consists of control information and user data, also known as a payload. The control information contains data for delivering the payload; such as network addresses and error detection and correction codes. | http://www.theshulers.com/whitepapers/internet_whitepaper/index.html |
|      | Internet Protocol address, known as IP address, is a numerical identifier assigned to one device on each network. This allows data packets to be sent to the correct address, similar to a house's mailbox. IPv4 and IPv6 are different versions of the IP address; IPv4 addresses are defined as a 32-bit number, whereas IPv6 are defined with 128 bit numbers. | RFC 760, *DOD Standard Internet Protocol*, DARPA, Information Sciences Institute (January 1980). |
|      | Routers are devices needed to connect to the internet as they route IP Packets across networks. Routers check the destination IP address in an IP packet to send out to the correct interface. Routers exchange information with neighbouring routers and create their own routing table, in a process called routing protocol; in order to reach their destination computer. Without routers, users would not be able to connect to the internet. | Ahmad, F (2016). "Machine-to-machine sensor data multiplexing using LTE-advanced relay node for logistics". Dynamics in Logistics. |
|      | A domain is a regulatory group of numerous private computer networks within the same system. In 1983, Paul Mockapetris proposed a distributed and dynamic DNS database that automatically mapped IP addresses to domain names; a system that is still in place today. The DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so that browsers can load Internet resources and  allows users to connect to websites using domain names rather than using IP addresses. | *Domain Names - Concepts and Facilities*, P. Mockapetris, The Internet Society (November 1987) |



| Q3           | **Define** the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:  - TCP  - HTTP and HTTPS  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)  **Explain** how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet *(50 - 150 words for each technology)* | 150 - 300 words per dot point                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TCP          | Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) was first introduced in 1974 by Robert Elliot Kahn and Vinton Cerf, where they proposed the fundamental communication protocols, TCP and IP (Internet Protocol) in their research article titled "A Protocol for Packet Intercommunication". Where IP is responsible for delivering packets to IP addresses and handling internetwork communication; TCP is responsible for detecting errors, re-arranging packet data and requesting re-transmissions through host-to-host communication.   <br /><br />Due to unpredictable network behaviour, load balancing traffic and network resource congestion, data packets sent using IP may be delivered out-of-order, duplicated or lost. TCP mitigates these issues by rearranging out-of-order data, requesting redelivery and minimizes network resource congestion. <br /><br />TCP is used in many major internet applications, such as the World Wide Web, e-mail, Peer-to-Peer file sharing, File Transfer Protocol, Secure Shell Protocol and remote administration. | (2006). *Internetworking with TCP/IP: Principles, Protocols, and Architecture*. **1** (5th ed.). Prentice Hall<br />https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/ |
| HTTP/S       | Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol which allows the transmission of resources, and is the foundation of data communication on the Web. HTTP operates as a message exchange pattern, or request-response protocol in a client-server computing framework. The client entity sends requests to a server, then the server processes the request and responds back to the client. | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview   |
| Web Browsers | Web browsers are application software dedicated to navigating and accessing the World Wide Web.<br />Web browsers are most oftentimes the client or user-agent (any tool that acts on behalf on the user). The browser initiates the request to fetch from the server, resources, such as hypermedia and other content, the browser then presents the user with the amalgamation of elements in which the user can interact with and navigate the web.<br /> Inside the Web browser contains a core software component called the browser engine. The primary function of the browser engine is to compile and interpret HTML documents, Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and other resources to transform the webpage into an interactive visual representation for the end-user on their specified device.<br /><br /><br />Included with most Web Browsers is a suite of powerful developer tools that allow the user to inspect, explore and debug HTML, CSS and JavaScript elements. | http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm<br />https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools |



| Q4   | **Identify** THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and **explain** the reasons for using each. | 50 - 100 words on each data structure                        |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | In the Ruby programming language, data structures can be defined as a way to organise and access data. <br />One of these data structures is the Array. An array consists of an ordered collection of objects, and identified by an array index. An array is useful for gathering results from a loop, maintaining order, and as a base for more advanced data structures.<br />Another data structure used in Ruby is the Hash data structure. The Hash data structure stores items with associated keys, so every value has a key, this is referred to as a key-value pair. Hashes are useful for associating data with a specific label, finding duplicates within an array and counting characters in a string.<br />One more data structure in the Ruby programming language is the Stack. The stack is a data structure that is similar to a stack of plates, where elements are the plates and the stack processes the elements until the stack is empty. A stack data structure can be useful by using it as a "to-do" list, flattening an array and reversing an array. The stack data structure has no indexing and adds new items in a last-in-first-out manner. | https://launchschool.com/books/ruby/read/hashes<br />https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/04/ruby-data-structures/<br />https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/03/computer-science-in-ruby-stacks/<br />https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.0/Array.htmlhttps://www.rubyguides.com/2015/05/ruby-arrays/ |

| Q5   | **Describe** the features of *interpreters* and *compilers* and how they are different. | 100 - 200 words on each way code is executed                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | When a computer programmer writes source code in a high-level programming language that is readable by humans it must be translated into machine code that the computer can understand. In order to translate the source code, the code must be run through an interpreter or compiler to create an executable program.<br />Compilers are computer programs that scan and analyse the entire source code written from one high-level programming language to a lower-level programming language. Compilers have many types which produce different forms such as: a cross-compiler, capable of creating executable code for a platform different to the one it is running on; a bootstrap compiler, a self-compiling compiler written in the source language it plans on compiling; a language rewriter and compiler-compiler. Compilers are generally more efficient than interpreters as the compiler makes all the translations from source code once.  Programming languages such as C, C++ and Java use compilers.<br />Interpreters on the other hand are computer programs that process instructions written in a programming or scripting language without needing to be compiled into a machine language program beforehand. Interpreters are generally slower than compilers at interpreting code as it analyses each statement and function in a program every time it is executed. Programming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby and Python use interpreters. | [Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compilers:_Principles,_Techniques,_and_Tools) by Alfred V. Aho, Ravi Sethi, Jeffrey D. Ullman - Second Edition, 2007<br />https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter |

| Q6   | **Identify** TWO commonly used programming languages and **explain** the benefits and drawbacks of each. | 200 - 400 words on each language                             |

|      | Ruby is a dynamic, open-sourced, object-oriented programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Publicly released in 1995 and achieving mass recognition and acceptance in 2006 by coders worldwide, Ruby was created by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto who combined his favourite programming languages Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada and Lisp. Rails is a full-stack development framework written in Ruby for building a variety of web applications. Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hasson and is one of the most popular tools to create web applications, with Shopify, Airbnb and Github using the framework to create their applications. <br />Ruby is used for web development and functional programming. It was developed to make developer's work more efficiently and be able to implement complex applications in a shorter amount of time. Since the Ruby language has a simple and clean syntax, new web developers are able to learn it faster. Ruby is also seen as a flexible and creative language, as it allows users to freely transform its parts and get things done in a variety of different methods.<br />The drawback to Ruby is that it is still fairly niche and while there is some, documentation, community and support are limited when compared to a programming language like Python. | https://www.educba.com/python-vs-ruby/<br />https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/<br />https://www.guru99.com/python-vs-ruby-difference.html |
|      | Python is a clear and powerful object-oriented programming language. Python is mainly used for academic, AI, machine learning and scientific programming. Python was created by Guido Van Rossum, a Dutch programmer in the late 1980s, inspired by a very high level programming language called SETL. Python is ranked as one of the most popular programming languages, utilised by large organisations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Shopify. Maintaining Python code is made easier as the Python language focuses on readability and simplicity, also making it a great choice for beginner programmers to learn. <br />One of the benefits of using Python is that connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files and many other tasks are supported through Pythons vast standard library. Another benefit is that it is very easy to test short sections of code in Python's interactive mode, including a bundled development environment called IDLE. <br />A drawback of using the Python language is that it is not really used in App development as it is weak when it comes to mobile computing. As Python has database access limitations, when comparing Python to JDBC (Java DataBase Connectivity) and ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity), Python is seen as underdeveloped and primitive. | https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Overview<br />https://www.guru99.com/python-vs-ruby-difference.html#3 |

| Q7   | IDENTIFIES TWO ethical issues and DISCUSSES THE EXTENT to which they are responsible in terms of the issues in their role as an IT professional.  IDENTIFIES sources of legal information relating to TWO ethical issues and DISCUSSES how they can integrate this within their practice as an IT professional. (*Word count guide: 200 words max*)  DISCUSSES ONE case study of a breach of ethics by an IT company or professional in terms of what should be done to prevent or mitigate a breach. Discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches.

|      | In terms of trading shares on the stock exchange, as an IT professional developing apps or web sites dedicated to trading shares there are some ethics to consider. There has been some discussion on the gamification and intentionally addictive design loops being developed in the finance tech scene and whether developers should be held accountable. Robinhood is an app that offers commission free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds, with polished UI design and celebratory confetti when transactions are made, many younger users (32% of users are between ages 25-34) are drawn towards its accessible design, however they are not properly educated about financial responsibility; around 1.5 million of their users were first-time traders on the Robinhood app. As the app is designed in a way to make trading shares more entertaining, users are more inclined to invest money into it without doing the research. I believe that these developers should be more responsible on how they design their app, especially when it concerns the livelihood and personal finance of users. | https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gambling-addiction-experts-see-familiar-aspects-robinhood-app-n1256213<br />https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-10-22/how-robinhood-s-addictive-app-made-trading-a-covid-pandemic-pastime |
|      | Maintaining control over the information an individual reveals and who can access that information has become increasingly difficult with the advancement of technologies. Laws and regulations related to privacy, data and information protection must continually adapt, reassess and comply to these changes. The protection of an individuals personal information (a broad range of information or opinion that could identify an individual) and which entities are able to access that data is something that IT professionals must be mindful of. As users are always sharing information online be it through e-mail, social networking sites and tracking cookies (user browser data stored on the users computer), it is the responsibility of the IT Professional for this information to not be easily accessible by any persons and misused by businesses and organisations. | https://repository.dinus.ac.id/docs/ajar/ethics_in_information_technology2c_5th_ed._0_.pdf |
|      | The Massachusetts Securities Division have filed a claim against the Robinhood app in an effort to revoke the broker-dealer license of the online brokerage, accusing the brokerage of using aggressive tactics to lure inexperienced investors and treating trading like a game. The Division claims violation of newly adopted standards of conduct for Massachusetts-registers broker-dealers by "marketing itself to Massachusetts investors without regard for the best interests of its customers and failing to maintain the infrastructures and procedures necessary to meet the demands of its rapidly growing customer base." As an IT professional, it is important to remain ethical and having a duty of care. By creating an addictive and easily accessible app to those that may be financially irresponsible can lead to devastating losses and declining mental health, as seen in the case of Alexander E. Kearns who committed suicide after seeing a negative cash balance of US$730,000 in his Robinhood trading account. This situation could have been avoided had the developers of the app educated new users to the risks of trading and screening new users with background checks on their financial status, much like how a bank screens its customers with their loans. | https://www.reuters.com/technology/robinhood-sues-invalidate-massachusetts-fiduciary-rule-2021-04-15/<br />https://www.sec.state.ma.us/sct/current/sctrobinhood/MSD-Robinhood-Financial-LLC-Complaint-E-2020-0047.pdf |
|      | Fair Information practices is a set of guidelines that oversees the collection and use of personal data provided by the United States Federal Commission. The main aim of the Fair Information practices is to prevent the unlawful collection of personal data, eliminate the storage of inaccurate personal data and stop the misuse of that data. <br />The core principles of privacy of the Fair Information practices are: Notice/Awareness, Choice/Consent, Access/Participation, Integrity/Security and Enforcement/Redress. For Notice/Awareness, users must be made aware of an entity's information practices before any information is collected from them. Without being aware of the practices, users are unable to make an informed decision on whether they should disclose personal information or not. On Choice/Consent, users must be allowed to choose how information collected from them may be used. By Opting-in or out, users take affirmative steps on their choice on whether or not their information is collected or used. With Access/Participation, users should be able to access and change information about themselves in order to correct misinformation and contest incomplete data.  Integrity/Security refers to the principle that user data should be accurate and secure. Data collectors must make measures to ensure that data is protected from loss and unauthorised access. Enforcement/Redress is the enforcement of these principles to ensure that the guidelines are effective. <br />I believe by adhering to these core principles and integrating them to my own practices, I can make safe decisions on how data is collected by users, give notice to how information is collected and used, and be mindful of who can access that information. | https://web.archive.org/web/20100309105100/http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm#Notice/Awareness |
|      | In late 2011, the Federal Trade Commission accused Facebook of engaging in "unfair and deceptive" practices, claiming that Facebook was misusing users' information without notifying or gaining consent from users. Facebook claimed that it would not share personal information with advertisers or with outside application developers and that deleted accounts with photos and videos would have no access. The FTC revealed that Facebook had not delivered on any of these claims and as settlement, Facebook had made changes to improve their Choice/Consent and Opt-out procedures. Another case in early 2018, Facebook admitted to mishandling over 87 million Facebook users in which their personal data was obtained without consent by now defunct British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. This information was then later used to provide assistance in political campaigns. Facebook were fined $5 billion by the FTC in July 2019 because of their privacy violations. <br />An IT Professional should see cases like these to understand the importance of privacy, data and information protection. In order to prevent or mitigate this type of ethical breach, an ethical IT Professional would strictly adhere to the core principles of the Fair Information practices. Users of their service would be fully aware of what personal information would be collected, be able to give consent to how their data is used or collected, be able to access this information at any time and correct any misinformation or complete and uncomplete data and know that any information that is collected is safe and secure from unauthorised access or deletion. The IT Professional would ensure they have a secure infrastructure that is unable to be easily accessed and communicate clearly on how they will use a users data and be responsible and honest with their actions. | https://www.businessinsider.com.au/cambridge-analytica-a-guide-to-the-trump-linked-data-firm-that-harvested-50-million-facebook-profiles-2018-3?r=US&IR=T |



| Q8   | Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language | 100                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | In programming, the control flow is the order in which instructions, functions and statements are executed. In Ruby, users can alter the flow of code by utilising control expressions. By using if..elsif..else statements, for/until/while loops and break/next/redo statements, users are able to transform the control flow of the code. | https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.1/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html |

| Q9   | Explain type coercion                                        | 100                                                          |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|      | Type coercion in programming is the conversion of one element type to another, i.e. converting an integer to a string. In Ruby, to convert the class of an object into a string, the method to_s would be called, and to convert the class of an object into an integer, the method to_i would be called. Using type coercion is necessary to avoid errors where data types conflict in the output. | https://ruby-doc.org/docs/ruby-doc-bundle/Tutorial/part_01/objects.html |

| Q10  | Explain data types, using examples                           | 100                                                          |

|      | In order to classify data when programming, data types are used. Data types instruct computers on how to work with that particular data in your code. In Ruby, users will encounter a variety of data types: strings, integers, floats, symbols, arrays and hashes. The string data type is a sequence of one or more characters, including letters, numbers and symbols, enclosed within a set of quotation marks (""), e.g. "Hello World". An integer data type like in maths, are whole numbers either positive, negative or zero. A float data type is similar to an integer, but instead of a whole number it can be either a rational or irrational number and contain fractional parts and contains a decimal point. A symbol data type is special in that it acts like a label and its value cannot be changed. The array data type is an ordered collection of objects and identified by an array index. It is represented within square brackets and contains multiple values within a single variable i.e. array = [1,2,3,4,5]. | https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-data-types-in-ruby |

| Q11  | Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”  - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem  - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified | N/A  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
|      | In order to solve this problem, I need to figure out how I interpret the question. There are different ways to interpret this question, one user might create a system focussed on the customer and another might create a system that focusses on the restaurant and its staff. To me, ideally if a customer would like to buy food of their choice, they should be able to customise food and drink items to their liking, so I would make a class for each Food and Drink and from those, I would have sub-classes, such as Cold Drinks and Hot Drinks, Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. I would then have a checkout class that processes each order that customers make, taking information from the different food/drink classes and their respective prices. |      |

| Q12  | Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program | 100  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
|      | The reason why the code is not working is because when you use the ```gets``` method, it turns the user input into a string, and when it is called to do mathematics it outputs an error because it is not an integer. The way to solve this would be to use type coercion and transform the string into an integer using ```gets.to_i``` . |      |

| Q13  | The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly. | N/A  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |

```ruby
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
    i = i + 1
end

arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]

print arr
```

| Q14  | Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:  1. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations  2. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart | N/A  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |
|      | for numbers(i) 1 to 100 run<br />inside that loop, run from number 2 to i, break if the number divided by i is a whole number<br />put i into an array for prime numbers<br />end loop<br />print prime numbers array |      |

| Q15  | Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem: *You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.* | N/A  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---- |

```RUBY
raining = false
temperature = 15

if raining == true && temperature < 15
    print "It's wet and cold"
elsif raining == false && temperature < 15
    print "It's not raining but cold"
elsif raining == false && temperature >= 15
    print "It's warm but not raining"
else 
    print "It's warm and raining"

| Q16  | ACME Corporation are hiring a new junior developer, as part of their hiring criteria they've created a "coding skill score" based on the specific competencies they require for this role; the more important the skill is for ACME corp, the more points it contributes to the "coding skill score" The skills are weighted as follows:  - Python (1)  - Ruby (2)  - Bash (4)  - Git (8)  - HTML (16)  - TDD (32)  - CSS (64)  - JavaScript (128)   Write a program that allows a user to input their skills and then tells them   a) Their overall "coding skill score"   b) Skills they may want to learn, and how much each one would improve their score | N/A  |
